# WeatherDashboard
WeatherDashboard is a project designed to display temperature data collected from a standalone temperature sensor. Initially developed as a website API to showcase the sensor's data, the project will evolve into a desktop application for easier access and management of temperature readings.


## Project Overview
This project aims to collect real-time temperature data from a sensor and present it in a user-friendly format. The data will eventually be displayed on a local interface, not a webpage, for direct access on your desk.


## Features
- Real-time temperature data collection from a temperature sensor.
- Display of current temperature readings in a readable format.
- Easy-to-use interface for viewing the collected data.
- Scalable to include additional sensor data (e.g., humidity, pressure, etc.).
- Eventually designed for desktop, eliminating the need for a web-based interface.


## Technologies Used
- **Sensor Hardware**: D1 mini Board, DHT22 Sensor, Graphic LCD 128x64 Module.
- **Programming Language**: Python, JavaScript & HTML.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Board Libraries for Arduino & Python Graphics Libraries.
